Hi, I’m Azad. In this video, I’ll walk through my Google Earth Engine project, which processes Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to let users select custom date ranges and visualize results on an interactive map. I’ll start with a live demo of the application, then dive into its technical layers: the frontend interface, backend logic


For your **Full-Stack Development with React, Django & Google Earth Engine** project, the most important packages from `requirements.txt` are:

1. **Django (5.1.6)** - Core backend framework.
2. **djangorestframework (3.15.2)** - Required for building REST APIs.
3. **django-cors-headers (4.7.0)** - Handles CORS to allow communication between React frontend and Django backend.
4. **earthengine-api (1.5.4)** - Essential for interacting with Google Earth Engine (GEE).
5. **google-auth (2.38.0)**, **google-auth-oauthlib (1.2.1)**, **google-auth-httplib2 (0.2.0)** - Required for authentication with Google services.
6. **google-api-python-client (2.162.0)** - Enables interaction with Google APIs.
7. **google-cloud-storage (3.0.0)** - If using Google Cloud Storage for hosting processed images.
8. **whitenoise (6.9.0)** - Helps serve static files efficiently in production.
